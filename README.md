# To-Do-List
## Project 0
A simple command-line to-do list application built in Python.
This project demonstrates OOP design, file persistence with JSON, and user input validation.
It allows users to manage their daily tasks directly from the terminal, offering features such as adding, editing, removing, and marking tasks as complete.
The program also automatically saves tasks to a JSON file so that progress is never lost between sessions.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Remove tasks (with confirmation for incomplete tasks)
- Mark tasks as complete
- View:
  - All tasks
  - Completed tasks
  - Uncompleted tasks
- Clear all tasks

All data is saved to tasks.json and automatically loaded on startup
